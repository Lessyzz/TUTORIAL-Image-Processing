# Image_Processing

Hello,
The first, i'm not supporting hacking, i just show how to running image processing ^^,

You need to change folder location on script at lines 16-25-33. 

Replace the locations there with your own.

You can find folder location, Right click to "Image Processing" folder, click to "Properties" and you can see folder "Location" copy paste it.

It's done ^^
